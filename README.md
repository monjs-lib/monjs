# What is Mon?

Mon is a library that ships utilities that work both in the web, and local engines like [Node](https://nodejs.org)

Mon also allows developers to write less code, and spend less time on tiny functions and more on the meaningful parts of software

# How can I install Mon?

Mon isn't even in Beta, and ships too little functions to use in production. It will have 1.0.0 sometime in the next 1-2 months

> But still! How do I install it?

We can't currently answer that question, because it's highly subject to change
